# Overview

This project is a continuation of the basic lane finding project. To learn more about this project, please see [writeup.md](writeup.md)


## Instructions for Advances Lane Finding

**Step 0:** Install relevant packages (OpenCV2, Numpy, matplotlib, Jupyter)

**Step 1:** Add any images or videos into [test_images/advance](test_images/advance) 
or [test_videos/advance](test_videos/advance) respectively

**Step 2:** To run the notebook's code, run `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window.
Then you can open [finding_lanes-advance.ipynb](finding_lanes-advance.ipynb) using Jupyter and run code cells

## Instructions for Basic Lane Finding

**Step 0:** Install relevant packages (OpenCV2, Numpy, matplotlib, Jupyter)

**Step 1:** Add any images or videos into [test_images/basic](test_images/basic) 
or [test_videos/basic](test_videos/basic) respectively

**Step 2:** To run the notebook's code, run `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window.
Then you can open [finding_lanes-basic.ipynb](finding_lanes-basic.ipynb) using Jupyter and run code cells

**Step 3:** Check the output folders ([test_images_output](test_images_output/) & [test_videos_output](test_videos_output/)) for annotated images with lane guides
